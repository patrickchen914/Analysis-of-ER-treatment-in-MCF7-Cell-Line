# Analysis of ER treatment in MCF7 Cell Line

### The estrogen receptor-α (ERα) is a transcription factor which plays a critical role in controlling cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. By recruiting various cofactors to estrogen response elements (EREs), ERα effectively induces or represses gene transcription.

### The [provided data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55922) consists of the mRNA expression profiles of MCF7 cells treated with or without estrogen (E2) treatment under negative controls siRNA, BRD4 siRNA or JQ1 treatment, in duplicates. 

### This analysis will be focusing on the two duplicates of the E2 treatment under negative control siRNA and trying to discover the E2 treatment’s potential uses. 

### The [R script](test.R) performed the differential expression analysis and generated the statistical plots.
